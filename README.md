# Data_Visualization

Task
Visualize natural groupings or clusters in each of the two given datasets (Clients.csv and
Patches.csv) using dimensionality-reduction & clustering algorithms. The goal is to interpret
groupings to extract meaningful insights.

Dataset 1: Clients.csv
This dataset refers to bank client information. Each row corresponds to a client.
Number of Instances: 43,193
Number of Variables: 9
1 - age (numeric)
2 - job : type of job (categorical: "admin.", "unemployed", "management", "housemaid",
"entrepreneur", "student", "blue-collar", "self-employed", "retired", "technician", "services")
3 - marital : marital status (categorical: "married", "divorced", "single"; note: "divorced"
means divorced or widowed)
4 - education (categorical: "secondary", "primary", "tertiary")
5 - default: has credit in default? (binary: "yes", "no")
6 - balance: average yearly balance, in euros (numeric)
7 - housing: has housing loan? (binary: "yes", "no")
8 - personal: has personal loan? (binary: "yes", "no")
9 - term: has term deposit? (binary: "yes", "no")


Dataset 2: Patches.csv
This dataset refers to cartographic data for observations made over different 30m × 30m
patches in the forests of Alberta, Canada. Each row corresponds to an observed patch.
Number of Instances: 15,120
Number of Variables: 7
1 - Elevation - Elevation in meters
2 - Slope - Slope in degrees
3 - Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology - Horz Dist to nearest surface water features
4 - Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology - Vert Dist to nearest surface water features
5 - Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways - Horz Dist to nearest roadway
6 - Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points - Horz Dist to nearest wildfire ignition points
7 - Tree - Tree found predominant in the observed patch. Can be either “Spruce” (meaning
Spruce tree was found predominant) or “Other” (meaning trees other than Spruce were
found predominant)
